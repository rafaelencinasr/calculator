This is the last project for the Foundations section of The Odin Project.

With this calculator you can add, subtract, divide, and multiply two numbers, while also being able to keep doing operations using the previews result. You can delete all the operands with the AC button, delete a digit if you miss click an incorrect number, and change your number from positive to negative and back again. 

Beware that this is a digital solar powered calculator (patent pending), so be careful about covering the solar cell with your mouse ;)
